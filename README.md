# Code and some notes constructed from the book Deep Learning and Physics (Springer, 2021) 

The notes are in Portuguese while the code (and the comments) is written mostly in English. We use Jupyter notebook for most of the work.

Credits to Akinori Tanaka, Akio Tomiya and Koji Hashimoto.

* We are now writing the notes part directly in LaTeX
